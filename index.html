                <p>
                    <span class="opening">Star Trek Voyager</span> is an American science fiction television series
                    created by Rick
                    Berman,
                    Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor. It originally aired from January 16, 1995, to May 23, 2001, on
                    UPN, lasting for 172 episodes over seven seasons. It is the fifth series in the Star Trek
                    franchise.
                </p>
                <p>Set in the 24th century, when Earth is part of a United Federation of Planets, it follows the
                    adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager as it attempts to return home to the Alpha Quadrant
                    after being stranded in the Delta Quadrant on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
                <p>Paramount Pictures commissioned the series following the termination of Star Trek: The Next
                    Generation to accompany the ongoing Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. They wanted it to help launch UPN,
                    their newly established network. Berman, Piller, and Taylor devised the series to chronologically
                    overlap with Deep Space Nine and to maintain thematic continuity with elements that had been
                    introduced in The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. The complex relationship between Starfleet
                    and ex-Federation colonists known as the Maquis was one such element and a persistent central theme.
                    Voyager was the first Star Trek series to feature a female commanding officer, Captain Kathryn
                    Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), as the lead character. Berman served as head executive producer in charge of
                    the overall production, assisted by a series of executive producers: Piller, Taylor, Brannon Braga,
                    and Kenneth Biller.</p>
                <p>Set in a different part of the galaxy from preceding Star Trek shows, Voyager gave the series'
                    writers space to introduce new alien species as recurring characters, namely the Kazon, Vidiians,
                    Hirogen, and Species 8472. During the later seasons, the Borg-a species created for The Next
                    Generationâ€”were introduced as the main antagonists. During Voyager's run, various episode
                    novelizations and tie-in video games were produced; after it ended, various novels continued the
                    series' narrative.</p>
                <p>The Borg are an alien group that appear as recurring antagonists in the Star Trek fictional universe.
                    The Borg are cybernetic organisms (cyborgs) linked in a hive mind called "The Collective". The Borg
                    co-opt the technology and knowledge of other alien species to the Collective through the process of
                    "assimilation": forcibly transforming individual beings into "drones" by injecting nanoprobes into
                    their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is
                    "achieving perfection".</p>
                <p>Aside from being recurring antagonists in the Next Generation television series, they are depicted as
                    the main threat in the film Star Trek: First Contact. In addition, they played major roles in the
                    Voyager and Picard series.</p>

                <p>The Borg have become a symbol in popular culture for any juggernaut against which "resistance is
                    futile", a common phrase uttered by the Borg.</p>
                <p>The Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy which had been lacking during the first
                    season of TNG; the Klingons were allies and the Romulans mostly absent. The Ferengi were originally
                    intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance failed
                    to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their
                    immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the TNG and Voyager eras
                    of Star Trek. In Voyager episode "Q2", even the near-omnipotent Q tells his son, "Don't provoke the
                    Borg!"</p>
